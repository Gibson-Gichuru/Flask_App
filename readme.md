This flask app is based on the book "Flask Web Development Developing Web Applications with Python" by Miguel Grinberg

I am learning the basics of Flask and Python Backend developing.
How an application processes data from database and how it is displayed in the web.
I am also learning the basics of Web Development with a tutorial on Udemy by Dr. Angela Wu.

I hope by the end of this journey I will be a proficient Full Stack Developer.
I hope to develop more apps and to never quit in this journey of Web Developing till I am a certified engineer.

I'll be seeing you after 12 weeks to see how far we have come in this journey of ours
